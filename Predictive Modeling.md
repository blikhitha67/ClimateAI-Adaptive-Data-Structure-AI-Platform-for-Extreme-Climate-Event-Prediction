## Predictive Modeling

- **Objective:** Predict extreme climate events (heatwaves, heavy rainfall) using historical data.
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Regression/Classification for prediction of temperature/rainfall extremes.
- **Input Features:** Temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, CO₂ levels, seasonal indicators.
- **Output:** Predicted probability of extreme event or predicted value of next-day temperature/rainfall.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, Accuracy, F1-score (depending on regression/classification task)
