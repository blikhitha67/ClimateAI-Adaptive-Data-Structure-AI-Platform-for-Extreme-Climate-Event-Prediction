## Data

The project uses **historical climate datasets** containing measurements such as:

- **Date/Time** – The timestamp of the recorded measurement
- **Region/Station** – Geographic location of the observation
- **Temperature (°C)** – Daily max, min, and average temperatures
- **Rainfall (mm)** – Daily precipitation
- **Wind Speed (km/h)** – Daily average wind speed
- **CO₂ Levels (ppm)** – Atmospheric CO₂ measurements
- **Humidity (%)** – Daily average humidity
- **Other environmental parameters** – Optional features such as solar radiation, pressure, etc.

**Dataset Sources:**  
- NOAA Climate Data: [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)  
- NASA Earth Observation: [https://neo.gsfc.nasa.gov/](https://neo.gsfc.nasa.gov/)  
- Kaggle climate datasets: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

The dataset has been **cleaned and preprocessed** to remove missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.
