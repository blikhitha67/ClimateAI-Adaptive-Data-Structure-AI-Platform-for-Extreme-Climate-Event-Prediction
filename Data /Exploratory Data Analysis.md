## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the climate dataset to understand trends, distributions, and relationships between variables. The following analyses were conducted:

1. **Missing Values Analysis** – Checked for null/missing values in all columns and handled them using mean imputation or removal.
2. **Descriptive Statistics** – Computed mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numeric features.
3. **Distribution Analysis** – Plotted histograms and density plots for temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and CO₂ levels.
4. **Correlation Analysis** – Calculated correlations between variables and visualized using a heatmap.
5. **Time-Series Trends** – Plotted temperature, rainfall, and CO₂ levels over time to detect seasonal and long-term trends.
6. **Outlier Detection** – Identified extreme values using boxplots to ensure data quality.
